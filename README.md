# <Timed-Quiz>

## Description

The purpose of the project is to create timed web quiz.

The project displays a series of questions and answer to the user, depending on how the user answers, the user is 'alerted' to whether or not they answered correctly. The quiz is also timed, the count down timer for the quiz starts immediately on the page load. The questions and answers are stored in a separate javascript file in an array. 

The questions and answers are selected using key/value pairs based on the current 'question index'. 

When the user finishes the quiz, the user is shown how many questions they got correct out of the five questions. Also, if the user completes the quiz before the timer hits '0', they are shown how many seconds they had left.

If the user runs out of time before they are able to finish the quiz, they are shown the number of correct questions they were able to complete before the timer hit '0'.


This project demonstrates basic HTML structuring, basic CSS styling, JS DOM manipulation, hooking up multiple JS files in a single project, handling user input, creating a countdown timer, and handling information stored in arrays within in separate files.
